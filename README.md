# üèõ Active Directory in Azure

In this project I outline the steps to set up a Server and Client using Azure. I then walkthrough how to set up Active Directory and connect a client to the domain. This includes creating users and security groups to administer the Domain Controller. I also explore DNS records and creating them for the domain. Finally, I look at creating network file shares and manipulating permissions for users in the domain.
